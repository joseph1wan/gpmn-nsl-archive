## Context

This repository is an archive of an all-in-one web portal for a retreat site our church manages. It was the beginning of the pandemic and internships were getting canceled across the board. Two friends and I wanted to provide an "internship" experience for some college students that attended my church. I acted as the project and product manager while my friends led the frontend and backend teams. The three of us managed a team of three frontend and three backend interns. We ran weekly Zoom meetings, taught the interns about REST APIs, learned and taught the tech stack, and contributed code. Unfortunately, we did not get very far on this project, but it was enough to get some of the students jobs, so the project was more-or-less a success.
